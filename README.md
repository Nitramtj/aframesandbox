# aframesandbox
This project is a personal sandbox for experimenting with A-Frame.

I am currently experimenting with hot swapping entities in a networked aframe environment. It's functional so you can try it by doing the following:

## Installation
> npm install

## Run
> npm start

Load two browser windows at localhost:8080. Modify the scene.html file and see the scene change on both your clients, without the page reloading!
